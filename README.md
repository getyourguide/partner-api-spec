## Test System
Please use the following test system during development: https://api.testing1.gygtest.com.

- Test data can be sent to the system (e.g. bookings). The system database gets reset periodically.
- Emails are blocked from being sent, but can be forwarded upon request.

## Request Limitation
The default rate limit is 60 calls per minute. Once the rate limit is reached, all subsequent calls will be blocked for the remaining time of the minute. GetYourGuide also monitors API traffic and warns about excessive usage in relation to bookings being made. It is strongly encouraged to access the API in real-time; please do not scrape the API in an attempt to cache its output.
